## Description

The Skyhook Embedded Client is a small library written in C. It is intended to be included in embedded targets (e.g.,
IoT devices) to allow those devices to use the Skyhook Precision Location service in order to obtain an estimate of the
geolocation of the device on which it runs. It is known as the 'embedded library', sometimes referenced as LibEL. This
repo also includes a sample client application which illustrates how the library can be used by your application (see
below).

Instructions for cloning and building the library are below.

## Change Log

### Release 4.0.0

* API simplifications.
* LibEL accepts timestamps with value 0 which indicates that time has not been synchronized.
* LibEL no longer holds state and cache in a static buffer. User allocates both request context buffer and session
  context buffer.
* User may call new API call, sky_get_cache_hit(), to determine whether the current request has a match in the cache.
* User may tune some configuration parameters at runtime.
* Code size optimizations.
* Build time options allow inclusion/exclusion of non-essential consistency checks.
* Common code sequences have been factored out.
* Some of the largest functions have been re-written.

### Release 3.0.3

* Remove client validation to allow GNSS fix with NSAT value of 0 to be added.

### Release 3.0.2

* Bug fix - server side tuning of cache match thresholds was being ignored by client

### Release 3.0.1

* Added support for Token Based Registration and authentication.
* Added support for Uplink and downlink data. Downlink data can be configured through a new web service/API.
* Added 'debounce' parameter to sky_open() which allows the option, in the case of a cache match, to report the cached
  information in a subsequent server request.
* Added plugin modules infrastructure, allowing basic or premium algorithms for filtering scans and interpreting server
  responses, and ability to expand LibEL's capabilities in the future.
* Cellular beacons now allow Timing Advance values to be added.
* Updated the sample_client application.
* Renamed .submodules to submodules.
* Additional bug fixes and improvements.

### Release 2.1.3

* Change default configuration to 20 total beacons, 15 APs
* Update to allow ID3 to be -1 SKY_UNKNOWN_ID3
* Bug fix - cache match fails if serving cell has changed
* Bug fix - copy actual number of beacons in workspace to cache
* Bug fix - sky_add_cell_lte_beacon(), tac must be signed and wider for SKY_UNKNOWN_ID3

### Release 2.0.0

* Additional arguments provided to sky_add_cell_lte_beacon(), sky_add_cell_umts_beacon()
  and sky_add_cell_nb_iot_beacon() to allow the user to optionally provide pci/psc/ncid and uarfcn/earfcn values.
* Support for optionally adding scanned neighbor cells (for LTE, UMTS, and NB_IOT cell types) via 3 new functions
  sky_add_cell_lte_neighbor_beacon(), sky_add_cell_umts_neighbor_beacon() and sky_add_cell_nb_iot_neighbor_beacon.

### Release 1.1.4

* Device ID length fix and a few changes to sample_client to allow full length of device_id to be used.

### Release 1.1.3

* Update to avoid ignoring server results in case no local clock is available, plus logging and other minor cleanups

### Release 1.1.1

* Initial public release

## Building

### Dependencies

#### Git Submodules

The library depends on several third-party repos which are included as submodules in this repo. In order to ensure that
these dependency repos are properly populated, be sure to add the `--recursive` option to the `git clone` command when
cloning this repo.

All submodules are contained within the `submodules` directory.

### Library Source Files

The library includes the following C source files:

* All `.h` and `.c` files in the `libel/` directory
* All `.h` and `.c` files in the `libel/protocol` directory (note that `el.pb.h`
  and `el.pb.c` can be regenerated by the protocol buffers compiler)
* `submodules/tiney-AES128-C/aes.{h,c}`
* `submodules/nanopb/pb_common.c`
* `submodules/nanopb/pb_encode.c`
* `submodules/nanopb/pb_decode.c`

### Build Directions

To build just the library in a Unix-like environment:

    $ make

This creates the file `bin/libel.a`, which can then be statically linked into your executable (in a Unix-like
environment). Of course it may be necessary to modify the provided Makefile (or replace it altogether) in order to build
the library for your platform.

To build and run the sample client (after building the library itself):

    $ cd sample_client
    $ make
    $ ./sample_client sample_client.conf

Note that `sample_client.conf` will likely require modification (to add your Skyhook AES key and partner ID).

## API Guide

### Summary

Skyhook's Embedded Library API for IoT provides an interface for the Client Application to build a Skyhook Location
Request and get an immediate location response when the IoT device is stationary (or in a remembered location), and an
encoded request that can be sent to the ELG server. The library also provides decoding and extracting of information (
including location) from the ELG server response message.

Requests consist of a set of beacons (Wi-Fi Access Points and Cell towers) which are within range of the client device.
These are packaged into the request and the Skyhook server processes the available information to determine the most
accurate location. The library balances accuracy of location against bandwidth of communication with the Skyhook server
by having a configurable, maximum size of each request. This is achieved as each Wi-Fi or Cellular beacon is added to
the request; the library selectively keeps or discards beacon information based on a carefully crafted algorithm.

The library will save the information provided in a request along with the location determined by the Skyhook server in
a cache and whenever subsequent requests are a reasonable match to the cache, the library will use the known location to
satisfy the request, eliminating the need to communicate with the server for this request. The number of locations in
the cache is configurable, and a value of 0 will disable caching.

### Requirements

1. Low memory use, both code and data size.
1. Low bandwidth i.e. Small messages, infrequently.
1. Avoid platform specific dependencies i.e. ELG library is written to be portable to many platforms.

### API conventions

* Application/device developer is responsible for providing the work space for any given request/response transaction.
* The address of this work space is considered the unique identifier for a given location request/response transaction.
* sky_errno is always set, either to `SKY_ERROR_NONE` or to the error code.
* The user may free the allocated work space after a location (lat/long) results from either sky_finalize_request() or
  sky_decode_response(), or an error from the API.
* The user is responsible for sending requests generated by the library to the server, and reporting responses received
  from the server to the library.
* The user must send request to the server, even when a location is returned from a cached response, if any of the three
  conditions are required: 1) downlink data is to be collected in a response, 2) uplink data needs to be sent to the
  server, 3) the cached location needs to be reported to the server to be forwarded by the ECHO service (debounce).
* If time() returns a date prior to March 1, 2019, API will not match cached scans/locations.
* The library is not thread safe.
* The user may preserve cache state by storing the state buffer provided by the call to sky_close(), and restoring the
  state buffer and passing it to sky_open().
* The library can interact with the server in either of two authentication modes, Token Based Registration (TBR) or a
  simple key based scheme. The best one for you will depend on licensing terms, privacy considerations and other
  specific implementation requirements
* The API calls used to add beacons from a scan provide a `is_connected` parameter which is used to indicate whether a
  particular beacon is actively serving the device i.e. a Wi-Fi AP which is connected and/or a Serving Cell.

### Authentication

For a full list of errors that can be reported when decoding a server response, see sky_decode_response().

#### Token Based Registration (TBR)

A device will remain authenticated during a valid licensed period, and thereafter if the license period is extended.
However, if there are repeated authentication failures, perhaps due to an expired contract, the library will enforce
service prohibition periods. An error will be returned, and sky_errno set to `SKY_ERROR_SERVICE_DENIED`, if the user
attempts to generate a request too soon after decoding an unauthorized response. Specific codes are reported when the
user is expected to delay the next request.

* `SKY_ERROR_SERVICE_DENIED` Service blocked due to repeated errors
* `SKY_AUTH_RETRY` retry immediately
* 'SKY_AUTH_RETRY_8HR' delay for 8 hours
* 'SKY_AUTH_RETRY_16HR' delay for 16 hours
* 'SKY_AUTH_RETRY_1D' delay for 1 day (24 hours)
* 'SKY_AUTH_RETRY_30D' delay for 30 days

#### Simple Key based

If the user has chosen to use the library in this mode, there are a few features that are not available, these are noted
in the remainder of the document with (TBR only). Authentication errors will result in an error being returned, and
sky_errno set to `SKY_ERROR_AUTH`.

### Client Configuration

Your embedded client needs to be configured with a Skyhook partner ID and AES (encryption) key. You can obtain these
parameters via the following steps:

1. Register a new account on http://my.skyhookwireless.com
2. Once registration is completed you will be placed immediately into the “Start a new project” workflow.
3. Create a new Precision Location project and name the project whatever you like.
4. After creating the project, in the platform selection screen, select the “ELG” embedded project type which can be
   found below the standard OS selection icons.
5. Once your new embedded project has been created, your partner ID and AES key will be visible on the right side of
   your project home screen. To enable Token Based Registration for your project, please reach out to your Skyhook
   account representative or contact support@skyhook.com

|Description                  |  Value                                      |
|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|                             |                                             |
| Skyhook API key             |"1E5D0AAEA1DEC1CD10DC2DD1CA11CE6B" (Example) |
| Partner ID                  |1 (Example)                                  |
| Skyhook ELG Server hostname|"elg.skyhook.com"                             |
| Skyhook ELG Server port     |9756                                         |

**Note** These value must be stored within the client application and passed to sky_open().

The Skyhook Embedded Library creates (see sky_finalize_request()) and interprets (see sky_decode_response()) messages
which are exchanged via a simple TCP (not HTTP) connection established by the client device (the "user") to the Skyhook
Embedded Library Gateway (ELG) server. This message exchange must be done for each call to sky_finalize_request() (
unless the library is able to use a previously cached location). Because they are usually platform-dependent, the
details associated with the establishment of this connection, and the associated send/receive mechanisms, are the
responsibility of the application developer. See the sample_client directory within the library repo for an example of
how this can be done using standard socket API calls.

In general, the user must take the following steps in order to perform this exchange:

1. Establish a TCP connection to the configured host and port number (see the Configuration Parameters table above)
2. Send the request
3. Wait for and then receive the response (use whatever timeout value is appropriate for the network in which the device
   is expected to run; the additional latency overhead imposed by the Skyhook service itself should be well under one
   second)
4. Close the TCP connection

The user may decide to add beacons from multiple scans to a single request. In an environment with few APs, high RF
interference or poor HW WiFi scan, this technique may improve accuracy and yield significantly. In an environment with
many APs, it has no impact. Time to fix in this case may be up to 10 seconds longer (1-3 seconds per scan depending on
the environment). This needs to be accounted in application layer and confirmed acceptable. There is minor battery
impact on power consumption due to multiple scans in some cases detailed above. The timestamp associated with each
beacon must accurately reflects the time at which the scan was captured.

The following are build time configuration parameters

* `CACHE_SIZE` allows a cache to be established. The value is the number of cachelines in the cache. A value of 0
  disables the cache. When a server response is decoded, the location and scan information is stored in the cache.
  Susequent calls to sky_finalize_request() will compare scan information in the request with the cache. If a good match
  is found, the cached location is returned along with a request buffer. The application may use the cached location (
  reduced network traffic) or send the request (update server with the uplink application data and position). For a
  stationary device the scan matching helps to significantly reduce the number of transactions to server (by 80 - 90%)
  and allows the client to report last known location without accuracy impact. This results in significant power
  consumption savings. For high speed moving devices (driving), scan matching fails typically and as a result it has no
  impact on battery or accuracy. For slow speed moving devices (walking/biking) the stationary logic helps reduce number
  of transactions to server by as much as 50% but may introduce some lag in reported fixes relative to device location.
* `SKY_MAX_DL_APP_DATA` allows the maximum size of downlink application data to be defined, however the default of 100
  is recommended. This provides the ability to limit the buffer space required to receive a response message. This value
  must accomodate the length of downlink application date set at the server. The server will not send application data
  that is longer than this value in response messages.
* `SKY_TBR_DEVICE_ID` this boolean value chooses whether a TBR location request carries with it the unique device ID.
  Devices using TBR authentication, which also make use of the ECHO service and wish to receive an identifier in
  Skyhook's device_id field, will need to build with `SKY_TBR_DEVICE_ID` `true' in order to correlate locations with a
  device. Alternatively, this information can be transmitted through uplink application data.
* `SKY_DEBUG` controls whether debug information is generated by the library. By default, it
  includes `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG` logging to assist with integration efforts. To remove this, build the library
  with `SKY_DEBUG` false. Passing a min_level value to sky_open() allows intermediate levels of logging.

## API Reference

### sky_open() - Initialize Skyhook library and verify access to resources

```c
Sky_status_t sky_open(Sky_errno_t *sky_errno,
    uint8_t *device_id,
    uint32_t id_len,
    uint32_t partner_id,
    uint8_t aes_key[AES_KEYLEN],
    char *sku,
    uint32_t cc,
    void *session_buf,
    Sky_log_level_t min_level,
    Sky_loggerfn_t logf,
    Sky_randfn_t rand_bytes,
    Sky_timefn_t gettime,
    bool debounce)

/* Parameters
 * sky_errno    if sky_open() returns failure, sky_errno is set to the error code
 * device_id    Device unique ID (example mac address of the device)
 * id_len       length if the Device ID, typically 6, Max 16 bytes
 * partner_id   Skyhook assigned credentials
 * aes_key      Skyhook assigned encryption key
 * sku          Skyhook assigned model number / product identifier
 * cc           Country Code (optional) country in which the device was registered. 0 if undefined
 * session_buf  pointer to a session buffer, either empty, or a restored buffer from previous session
 * min_level    logging function is called for msg with equal or greater level
 * logf         pointer to logging function
 * rand_bytes   pointer to random function
 * gettime      pointer to time function
 * debounce     true to report matching cache location in request (stationary detection)
 *
 * Returns      `SKY_SUCCESS` or `SKY_ERROR` and sets sky_errno with error code
 */
 ```

Called once to set up any resources needed by the library (e.g. cache space). Returns `SKY_SUCCESS` on
success, `SKY_ERROR` on error and sets sky_errno. If state_buf is not NULL and points to a valid state buffer, it is
restored and populates the cache. If sky_state is not NULL and points to a invalid state buffer it is considered an
error (`SKY_ERROR_BAD_SESSION_CTX`). If sku is a non-zero length string, LibEL will attempt to use TBR authentication
otherwise a simple key based authentication is used. cc is the Mobile Country Code of the country in which the device
was registered to operate. If logf() is not NULL, the log messages will be generated if they were turned on during
compilation (`SKY_DEBUG`). If rand_bytes is not NULL, this function pointer is used to generate random sequences of
bytes, otherwise the library calls rand(). If min_level can be set to block less severe log messages, e.g. if min_level
is set to `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR`, only log messages with level `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL` and `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR` will be
generated. gettime is required. This function pointer is used to request the current time (Unix time aka POSIX time aka
UNIX **Epoch** time). If the system may use LibEL before time has been synchronized, gettime must return 0 to indicate
time is not known. When debounce is false, the generated request always reports the beacons from the request context to
the server. When true, and a previously cached location is a match, the cached beacons are reported to the server. While
a device is stationary, and using the cached location, any server requests will resolve to a stable location.

`sky_open()` may report the following error conditions in sky_errno:

| Error Code                                      | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_ERROR_NONE`                                | No error
| `SKY_ERROR_NO_PLUGIN`                           | At least one plugin must be registered
| `SKY_ERROR_ALREADY_OPEN`                        | sky_open() called more than once with different parameters. Call sky_close()
| `SKY_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`                      | The parameters to the current operation are illegal

### sky_sizeof_session_ctx() - Get the size of the non-volatile memory required to save and restore the library state.

```c
int32_t sky_sizeof_session_ctx(void *session)

/* Parameters
 * session          Pointer to session buffer, or NULL to request the size of a new empty session buffer.

 * Returns          Size of session buffer or 0 to indicate that the buffer was invalid
 */
 ```

Can be used to determine the size of a session buffer that is being restored from a pervious LibEL session, or the size
of a new empty buffer that the User is allocating for an initial session. When LibEL is opened, a session buffer must be
provided, in RAM, either initialized with the contents from a previous, saved, buffer, or an empty buffer. The session
buffer contains the cache and other library state. Copying the session buffer to non-volatile memory after closing the
library and copying from non-volatile memory to RAM before opening the library allows the state of the library to be
preserved during periods where RAM contents may be lost e.g. low power modes.

### sky_sizeof_request_ctx() - Determines the size of the work space required to process the request

```c
int32_t sky_sizeof_request_ctx(void)

/* Returns          Size of workspace buffer required
 */
```

Reports the number of bytes of work space buffer required to handle encoding the request. This should be allocated by
the caller and a pointer to this allocated space passed to sky_new_request(). This space is used to accumulate the
beacon information to form the server request. It also holds any downlink application data. This space should be freed
after receiving a location (lat/long) from either sky_finalize_request() or sky_decode_response(), or an error from the
API and after processing downlink application data.

### sky_new_request() - Initializes work space for a new request

```c
Sky_ctx_t* sky_new_request(void *ctx,
    uint32_t bufsize,
    void *session,
    uint8_t *ul_app_data,
    uint32_t ul_app_data_len,
    Sky_errno_t *sky_errno
)

/* Parameters
 * ctx                  Pointer to request context buffer provided by user
 * bufsize              Buffer size (from sky_sizeof_request_ctx)
 * session              Pointer to session context buffer provided to sky_open
 * ul_app_data          Pointer to uplink data buffer
 * ul_app_data_len      Length of uplink data buffer
 * sky_errno            Pointer to error code

 * Returns              Pointer to the initialized workspace context buffer or NULL
 */
```

Initializes context buffer for a new request. Returns request context (pointer to the work space) or NULL in case of
failure. In case of failure sky_errno is set to indicate the error. User can decode the error using sky_perror().
Initializes request context with Magic numbers, sets downlink app data buffer to empty and saves uplink app data.

sky_new_request() may report the following error conditions in sky_errno:

| Error Code                                      | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------

 */
 ```

Adds the NR neighbor cell information to the request context. Returns `SKY_ERROR` for failure or the `SKY_SUCCESS`. In
case of failure sky_errno is set if there is a bad parameter or other error.

sky_add_cell_nr_neighbor_beacon() may report the following error conditions in sky_errno:

| Error Code                                      | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_ERROR_NONE`                                | No error

| `SKY_ERROR_INTERNAL`                            | An unexpected error occured

### sky_add_gnss() - Adds the position of the device from GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, or others) to the request context

```c
sky_status_t sky_add_gnss(sky_ctx_t *ctx,
sky_errno_t *sky_errno,
float lat,
float lon,
uint16_t hpe,
float altitude,
uint16_t vpe,

 */
 ```

Adds the GNSS information to the request context. Returns `SKY_ERROR` for failure or the `SKY_SUCCESS`. In case of
failure sky_errno is set to error code.

sky_add_gnss() may report the following error conditions in sky_errno:

| Error Code                                      | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_ERROR_NONE`                                | No error
| `SKY_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`                      | The parameters to the current operation are illegal
| `SKY_ERROR_BAD_REQUEST_CTX`                     | The workspace context structure is corrupt

### sky_sizeof_request_buf()  - determines the size of the network request buffer which must be provided by the user

```c
Sky_status_t sky_sizeof_request_buf(Sky_ctx_t *ctx,
    uint32_t *size,
    Sky_errno_t *sky_errno
)

/*
 * Parameters
 * ctx              Skyhook request context
 * sky_errno        sky_errno is set to the error code
 * size             Request size in bytes stored here

 * Returns          `SKY_SUCCESS` or `SKY_ERROR` and sets sky_errno with error code
 */
 ```

Called after all beacon and GNSS data has been added (via the sky_add_*() functions) in order to determine the size of
the request buffer that must be allocated by the user. The size returned includes the length of any uplink application
data reported to sky_new_request().

sky_sizeof_request_buf() may report the following error conditions in sky_errno:

| Error Code                                      | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_ERROR_NONE`                                | No error
| `SKY_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`                      | The parameters to the current operation are illegal
| `SKY_ERROR_BAD_REQUEST_CTX`                     | The workspace context structure is corrupt
| `SKY_ERROR_ENCODE_ERROR`                        | Could not encode the request

### sky_finalize_request() - generate a Skyhook request from the request context

```c
Sky_finalize_t sky_finalize_request(Sky_ctx_t *ctx,
    Sky_errno_t *sky_errno,
    void *request_buf,
    uint32_t bufsize,
    Sky_location_t *loc,
    uint32_t *response_size
)

/* Parameters
 * ctx              Skyhook request context
 * sky_errno        sky_errno is set to the error code
 * request_buf      Request buffer (allocated by the user) into which the Skyhook server request will be encoded
 * bufsize          Request buffer size in bytes (should be set to the result of the call to sky_sizeof_request_buf() function)
 * loc              Pointer to the structure where latitude, longitude are written
 * response_size    the space required to hold the server response

 * Returns          `SKY_FINALIZE_REQUEST`, `SKY_FINALIZE_LOCATION` or `SKY_FINALIZE_ERROR` and sets sky_errno with error code
 */
 ```

Returns `SKY_FINALIZE_ERROR` and sets sky_errno if an error occurs. If the result is `SKY_FINALIZE_REQUEST`, the request
buffer is filled in with the serialized request data which the user must then send to the Skyhook server, and the
response_size is set to the maximum buffer size needed to receive the Skyhook server response. If the result
is `SKY_FINALIZE_LOCATION`, the location (lat, lon, hpe and source) are filled in from a previously successful server
response held in the cache. The user may decide to send a request to the ELG server, even though a previously cached
location was found. This allows (uplink) application data to be reported to the server, downlink application data to be
collected from the server and, when sky_open() is called with debounce = 'true', the set of cached beacons to be sent to
the server that produced the previously reported (cached) location. This allows for optional server updates during
periods when the device is stationary. If the error `SKY_ERROR_SERVICE_DENIED` is returned, the request was submitted
too often with repeated Authentication failures. The user may generate a new request after correcting the problem (TBR
only).

sky_finalize_request() may report the following error conditions in sky_errno:

| Error Code                                      | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_ERROR_NONE`                                | No error
| `SKY_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`                      | The parameters to the current operation are illegal
| `SKY_ERROR_BAD_REQUEST_CTX`                     | The workspace context structure is corrupt
| `SKY_ERROR_ENCODE_ERROR`                        | Could not encode the request
| `SKY_ERROR_SERVICE_DENIED`                      | LibEL temporarily blocked this service after repeated fails to authenticate (TBR only)
| `SKY_ERROR_NO_BEACONS`                          | Beacons must be added before a request can be finalized

### sky_decode_response() - decodes a Skyhook server response

```c
Sky_status_t sky_decode_response(Sky_ctx_t *ctx,
    Sky_errno_t *sky_errno,
    void *response_buf,
    uint32_t bufsize,
    Sky_location_t *loc
)

/* Parameters
 * ctx              Skyhook request context
 * sky_errno        sky_errno is set to the error code
 * response_buf     buffer holding the skyhook server response
 * bufsize          Size of response buffer in bytes as returned by sky_finalize_request()
 * loc              where to save device latitude, longitude etc from cache if known

 * Returns          `SKY_SUCCESS` or `SKY_ERROR` and sets sky_errno with error code
 */
```

User calls this to process the network response from the Skyhook server. Returns `SKY_ERROR` and sets sky_errno if the
response buffer could not be decoded or other error occurred, otherwise `SKY_SUCCESS` is returned. Cache is updated with
scan and location information. Note that sky_decode_response() modifies the response buffer (it is written with
decrypted bytes). A DEBUG level log message is available to help diagnose any errors that may happen. If the server
sends downlink application data in the response, it is copied into the workspace and loc is updated with its length and
a pointer to the data. Zero length indicates that there was no data. Note that if the user allocated the memory for the
workspace, the downlink data is unavailable after this memory has been freed. If the request required an authentication
registration step, sky_decode_response() returns `SKY_ERROR`, and sets sky_errno to `SKY_RETRY_AUTH`. The user is
expected to call sky_finalize_request() again and re-send the request (TBR only).

If `SKY_SUCCESS` is returned, the locations_source field provides information about how the location was derived from
the scan.

sky_decode_response() may report the following error conditions in sky_errno:

| Error Code                                      | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_ERROR_NONE`                                | No error
| `SKY_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`                      | The parameters to the current operation are illegal
| `SKY_ERROR_DECODE_ERROR`                        | LibEL was unable to decode the response message
| `SKY_ERROR_SERVER_ERROR`                        | Server sent a response which indicated an error processing the request
| `SKY_ERROR_LOCATION_UNKNOWN`                    | Server failed to determine a location
| `SKY_ERROR_AUTH`                                | Server failed to authenticate the request
| `SKY_AUTH_RETRY`                                | Server indicated that authentication was required and user must retry (TBR only)
| `SKY_AUTH_RETRY_8HR`                            | Server indicated that authentication failed. Service is blocked for 8 hours (TBR only)
| `SKY_AUTH_RETRY_16HR`                           | Server indicated that authentication failed. Service is blocked for 16 hours (TBR only)
| `SKY_AUTH_RETRY_24HR`                           | Server indicated that authentication failed. Service is blocked for 24 hours (TBR only)
| `SKY_AUTH_RETRY_30DAY`                          | Server indicated that authentication failed. Service is blocked for 30 Days (TBR only)

### API Location Result

The library returns location information as `Sky_location_t` from sky_decode_response():

```c
typedef struct sky_location {
    float lat, lon; /* GNSS info */
    uint16_t hpe;
    uint32_t time;
    Sky_loc_source_t location_source;
    Sky_loc_status_t location_status; /* reserved */
    uint8* dl_app_data;
    uint8 dl_data_len;
} Sky_location_t;
```

The location_source field can have one of the following values:

| Location Source                                 | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_LOCATION_SOURCE_HYBRID`                    | A combination of beacon types was used to derive the location

| `SKY_LOCATION_SOURCE_UNKNOWN`                   | Location source unknown

### API sky_finalize_request() result

sky_finalize_request() returns a result as `Sky_finalize_t`:

| sky_finalize_request result                     | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_FINALIZE_ERROR`                            | Unable to process request context
| `SKY_FINALIZE_LOCATION`                         | The location is known e.g. stationary
| `SKY_FINALIZE_REQUEST`                          | Context contains a server request

### API Logging levels

The level at which the library generates log messages can be configured by passing `min_level` with one of these values
to `sky_open()`:

| Logging Level                                   | Description
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL`                        | Information about an error which caused library to immediately close
| `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR`                           | Information about an operation which failed
| `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING`                         | Information about an operation which is continuing with unexpected condition
| `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG`                           | Verbose information about the operation being performed

**Note** the above table is in decending severity order

Setting min_level blocks less severe log messages. A level of `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG` will include all
logging, `SKY_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR` will include error and critical log messages.
