Skyhook embedded-lib
====================

The Skyhook embeeded-lib is a small library written in C. It is intended to be
included in embedded targets (e.g., IoT devices) to allow those devices to use
the Skyhook Precision Location service in order to obtain an estimate of the
geolocation of the device on which it runs. This repo also includes a sample client application
which illustrates how the library can be used by your application (see below).

Dependencies
------------

### Git Submodules
The library depends on several third-party repos which are included as
submodules in this repo. In order to ensure that these dependency repos are
properly populated, be sure to add the `--recursive` option to the `git
clone` command when cloning this repo.

All submodules are contained within the `.submodules` directory. These are:

    .submodules/embedded-lib-protocol
        https://github.com:SkyhookWireless/embedded-lib-protocol
    .submodules/nanopb
        https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb
    .submodules/tiny-AES128-C
        https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c

### Google Protocol Buffers
The client/server network protocol used by the Skyhook library is based on [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). Therefore the following components are required to build the library:
* Python version 3.6.0 or later
* Google Protocol Buffers `protoc` compiler version 3.3.0 or later
* Google protobuf Python module version 3.7.1 or later

Library Contents
----------------

Building the library following directions below, produces one result, bin/libel.a
which contains the following modules, with the listed header file dependencies:

    libel/libel.c -> libel.o
        libel/beacons.h
        libel/config.h
        libel/crc32.h
        libel/libel.h
        libel/protocol/proto.h
        libel/utilities.h
        libel/workspace.h
    libel/utilities.c -> utilities.o
        libel/beacons.h
        libel/config.h
        libel/crc32.h
        libel/libel.h
        .submodules/tiny-AES128-C/aes.h

        .submodules/tiny-AES128-C/aes.h
        libel/utilities.h
        libel/workspace.h
    libel/crc32.c -> crc32.o
    libel/protocol/proto.c -> proto.o
        libel/beacons.h
        libel/config.h
        libel/crc32.h
        libel/libel.h
        libel/protocol/el.pb.h
        libel/protocol/proto.h
        libel/utilities.h
        libel/workspace.h
    libel/protocol/el.pb.c -> el.pb.o*
        libel/protocol/el.pb.h
    .submodules/nanopb/pb_common.c -> pb_common.o
    .submodules/nanopb/pb_encode.c -> pb_encode.o
    .submodules/nanopb/pb_decode.c -> pb_decode.o
    .submodules/tiny-AES128-C/aes.c -> aes.o

*note el.pb.c is generated by Google protoc tool

Build Directions
----------------

To build just the library in a Unix-like environment:

    $ make

This creates the file `bin/libel.a`, which can then be statically linked into your executable (in a Unix-like environment). Of course it may be necessary to modify the provided Makefile (or replace it altogether) in order to build the library for your platform.

To build and run the sample client (after building the library itself):

    $ cd sample_client
    $ make
    $ ./sample_client sample_client.conf

Note that `sample_client.conf` will likely require modification (to add your
Skyhook AES key and partner ID).
